SEDkit is a collection of pure Python 3.5 modules for simple SED construction and analysis. Users can create individual SEDs or SED catalogs from spectra and/or photometry and calculate fundamental parameters (f~bol~, M~bol~, L~bol~, T~eff~, mass, log(g)) using the methods presented in [Filippazzo et al. (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...810..158F).

Requirements:
- astropy v3.0.2+
